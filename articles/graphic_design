While digging around for creative inspiration for my website, comedian and entertainer Sam Hyde appeared in a youtube short. He does some crazy stuff but his videos typically are pure comedy gold. The dude also graduated from art school, incredible stuff right there.

Anyway, one of his videos mentioned taking art direction from old 90's based art books and advertisements.

Mentioning instead of computer fonts, type faces for text and the basic principles of design. Grid systems and emigre mazagines. I find this stuff absolutely interesting.

The vaporwave and boring sort of designs of today calling back and less homaging the material and more ripping it outright in a less artistic way.

I see this viewpoint from Sam Hyde and I share it. No more should one focus on white text on black grounds, fancy slanting of text with italics. Utilize techniques and abilities from the past to pay respects while also putting your own spin on it.

Understand fundamentally why the thing was designed, squint even and remove all the noise. Observe where your eyes move. The image is black and white, no color, what draws you in? Stuff like that facinates me.

I think I'll depart... But with this thought.

Take from the past, sure. But give back.

Also state your inspirations for the next artist to come by and understand what and why.
