=== ideas ===
> php article creation with database
> javascript array tagline change on refresh
> no form usage as outdated
> mailto icon as usual
> left to right reading therefore, merge nav and icons to top (the business and noise at the top)
> Creation of low impact but creative snopoint letter specific favicon
> entire rem/em implementation, vh and vw for viewport block sizing
> no more usage of px and %
> For stylings, do not be afraid of gradients, can add a certain panache to design elements
> potential for logo change on refresh, might have to point back to db or folder and random func to get this to function
> usage of webp images for faster loading times
> make website keyboard friendly with tabs (see lukesmith.xyz)
> DO NOT ADD SOCIAL MEDIA LINKS TO NAV, IT SUCKS
> ADD A CALL TO ACTION LIKE MAIL TO, TO THE NAVRIGHT ELEMENT

BASIC DESIGN:
> NAV IS ALWAYS VISIBLE, CTA IN TOP RIGHT
> 3 MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCTS/SERVICES
> 
> WHO ARE YOU
> WHAT CAN YOU DO?
> HOW CAN YOU HELP ME?
CALL TO ACTION
